# Vercel Playwright Issue - Fixed with Graceful Fallback

## The Problem

```
BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /tmp/.playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome
```

Vercel's Python serverless environment doesn't support Playwright browsers natively.

## Short-Term Solution (IMPLEMENTED)

Created `VercelScraper` that gracefully handles Playwright availability:

1. **Tries Playwright first** (if available)
2. **Falls back to SimpleScraper** (HTTP-only) if Playwright fails
3. **Returns clear warning** when technical indicators are unavailable

### What This Means:

Your API will now:
- ✅ Deploy successfully to Vercel (no more errors)
- ⚠️ Return **empty technical indicators** (Playwright not available)
- ✅ Return **pivot points** (these work without JavaScript)
- ✅ Include warning message explaining the limitation

### Response Format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "warning": "Technical indicators unavailable: Playwright required but not installed. Only pivot points are available.",
  "data": {
    "parsed": {
      "technicalIndicators": [],  // Empty
      "movingAverages": [],        // Empty
      "pivotPoints": [...]         // Works!
    }
  }
}
```

## Long-Term Solutions

See `VERCEL_PLAYWRIGHT_SOLUTION.md` for detailed options:

### Recommended: Railway.app (Easiest)

Deploy to Railway.app instead of Vercel - it supports Playwright natively.

**Steps:**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

Railway automatically installs Playwright browsers. No configuration needed!

### Alternative: Scheduled Scraping

1. Keep Vercel for API (reading data)
2. Run scraper separately on Railway/Docker (with Playwright)
3. Scraper runs on schedule, saves to Supabase
4. Vercel API just reads from database

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Better performance (no wait for scraping)
- ✅ Lower costs (scrape once, serve many times)
- ✅ Technical indicators work

## Current State

**Files Changed:**
1. `src/scrapers/vercel_scraper.py` - New graceful fallback scraper
2. `api/scrape.py` - Uses VercelScraper instead of InvestingScraper
3. `VERCEL_PLAYWRIGHT_SOLUTION.md` - Detailed migration guide

**What Works Now:**
- ✅ Deploys to Vercel without errors
- ✅ Multi-crypto support (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- ✅ Pivot points extraction
- ✅ Database integration
- ⚠️ Technical indicators (empty - needs Playwright)

## Next Steps

**Choose your path:**

1. **Accept current limitation**: Deploy as-is, technical indicators will be empty
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Migrate to Railway.app**: Get full Playwright support
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

3. **Set up scheduled scraping**: Best of both worlds
   - See `VERCEL_PLAYWRIGHT_SOLUTION.md` Option 5

## Testing Current Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Test - should work but with warning
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/scrape?crypto=BTC"

# Response will include:
# - success: true
# - warning: "Technical indicators unavailable..."
# - technicalIndicators: [] (empty)
# - pivotPoints: [...] (populated)
```

## Recommendation

For full functionality, **deploy to Railway.app** or set up **scheduled scraping**.

Both options provide complete technical indicators support and are documented in `VERCEL_PLAYWRIGHT_SOLUTION.md`.
